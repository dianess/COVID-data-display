In the Economic Policy Institute of Northern Arizona University, our team sent out several surveys to business leaders to help our county and city managers and economic development leaders get some quick feedback on the effects of the shutdowns on our local businesses. <img src="/WebVisualizations/Resources/images/County_3_Pulse_Compare.png" alt="County 3 Pulse Comparison">

In addition to a county view, we broke out several cities plus a rural component. This chart shows the comparison of the most recent survey (Pulse 3) for the county and the breakouts. <img src="/WebVisualizations/Resources/images/County_Pulse3_Snapshot.png" alt="Pulse 3 Snapshot">

Only the north part of the city of Sedona is in Coconino County, but Sedona's city management decided to include all of their businesses in this survey.
